##Interface for a Javascript powered robot
![ScreenGrab](http://inodebot.herokuapp.com/img/iNodebotScreen.jpg)
This is a simple interface that streams instructions to my little nodebot. Whats interesting about this project is it uses the [famo.us](http://famo.us/) framework to deliver a total javascript frontend. I've integrated the famo.us starter kit with a simple express setup to give me routes.

I personally really enjoy using famo.us I find it really addictive and very pleasing. This little project is giving me an opportunity to learn to create the basic elements of a standard website. I really enjoyed watching the 'Demo Day' videos on their youtube channel.
