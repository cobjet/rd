METEOR BLOG ENGINE
=

This is a simple blog engine being written in Meteor with the aid of Polymer.

I've found that Meteor is a dream from a code standpoint.  I have had some issues with the magic happening behind the curtains, which makes it hard to debug until you really understand what tools are available.  Once you find out where to look, it's easy again.

I see a long and well-deserved future for Meteor as a platform.
