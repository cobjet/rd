polymer-meteor-famous-views
===========================

Combination of Polymer, Meteor.js, and famous-views

Using meteor.js 

I created a meteor app.
Then using this package: https://github.com/ecwyne/meteor-polymer

Installed the packages to add polymer, and polymer-elements.

I then added the various link-rel needed to get access to the polymer elements.

I then made a custom polymer element to wrap the paper-fab button so I could easily call it in the click event on the main.js.

Finally I installed famous-views (first raix/famono, then the views). http://famous-views.meteor.com/

Wrapped all that in a famous surface!! Yay.  Have fun.
